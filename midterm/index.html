            <p>The theme I would like to present is a kind of a beed curtain.
            <br>
            I made 1/8 of the width as the pillar.
            <br>
            I chose the different color rectangles for the background which is in the back of the beed curtan.
            <br>
             I also chose the different color ellipses to represent the whole beed curtain.</p>
